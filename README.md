The aim of developing a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to classify images of plastic waste is to create an automated system that can accurately identify and categorize different types of plastic waste in images. This can help in waste management, recycling efforts, and environmental monitoring. By training the CNN on a large set of labeled plastic waste images, the model can learn to recognize various plastic items, helping reduce human effort in sorting and improving recycling efficiency.

Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of deep learning model designed specifically for processing image data. Here's how they could be applied:

Image Preprocessing: Images of plastic waste are collected, labeled, and preprocessed (resized, normalized) to ensure consistency and quality.

Training: The CNN learns from a large dataset of labeled images. The network will detect patterns, shapes, and colors of different plastic materials like PET, PVC, polystyrene, etc., through layers of convolution and pooling.

Feature Extraction: As the network learns, it extracts relevant features like texture, color, and edges that distinguish one plastic type from another.

Classification: The final layers of the CNN classify the images into categories, such as plastic types (e.g., PET bottles, plastic bags, food packaging). The model could also be trained to detect other important features like contamination levels (e.g., clean vs. contaminated plastics).

Model Evaluation: After training, the model is tested with new, unseen images to evaluate its performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
